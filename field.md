- To introduce key tools for linguistic annotation and analysis, including [ELAN](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan), [FLEx](https://software.sil.org/fieldworks/download/), and [SayMore](https://software.sil.org/saymore/).
- To highlight best practices in language archiving, metadata standards, and digital preservation.
- To encourage community mobilisation and language revitalisation efforts through participatory
approaches.

## Key Features in a nutshell
The workshop will focus on practical demonstrations on data collection, transcription, and annotation. Hands-on training using actual linguistic software tools will be given to the participants.
