The [School of Languages and Linguistics](https://jadavpuruniversity.in/academics/school-of-languages-and-linguistics/) at [Jadavpur University](https://jadavpuruniversity.in), Kolkata, is delighted to announce the 47th International Conference of the Linguistic Society of India (ICOLSI-47), to be held from 12th to 14th November 2025. ICOLSI is the flagship conference of the [Linguistic Society of India](https://www.lsi.org.in) and is held annually. We invite scholars, researchers, and students to submit their original research papers for presentation at this prestigious event.

## Conference Theme: Interfaces in Linguistics

The conference will feature a special thematic focus on "Interfaces in Linguistics", exploring the intersections and interactions between various sub-disciplines within linguistics. We encourage submissions that highlight how discoveries in one area of linguistics have informed and enriched other areas. For example, research on the syntax-phonology interface has advanced our understanding of both phrase structure and intonational phonology, while findings in phonetics have significantly contributed to forensic linguistics. We also welcome interdisciplinary research that bridges linguistics with adjacent fields such as cognitive science, psychology, forensics, and computer science, provided the work has a clear linguistic focus.

## Non-Thematic Sessions

In addition to the thematic sessions, the conference will also include non-thematic sessions covering a wide range of topics in linguistics. These sessions are open to all areas of linguistic research, including but not limited to phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, computational linguistics, and historical linguistics and allied components of linguistics. We encourage submissions that present innovative research, theoretical insights, and empirical findings across the diverse spectrum of linguistic inquiry. These sessions aim to provide a platform for scholars to share their work and engage in discussions that span the breadth of linguistic studies.

## Submission Guidelines

### Abstract Submission

Anonymized abstracts should be submitted through [EasyAbs](https://easyabs.linguistlist.org/submit/ICOLSI-47/) to ensure a transparent and constructive review process. Detailed guidelines for submission will be available on the conference website. To ensure a fair opportunity to everyone, the conference will permit only one first-author submission per participant. Every paper that is accepted for oral or poster presentation would have to have a unique registered author.
