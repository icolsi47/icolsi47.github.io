## Abstract

Variability in word production is pervasive, less so perhaps in perception. Nevertheless,
phonological grammars of the speaker and the listener must maintain a level of harmony for
the rapport between them to be sustained. Against the age-old wisdom that language
constantly changes, and that phonological change in particular is inevitable given that
speakers’ and hearers’ objectives are antagonistic (ease of articulation vs. clarity of the
message), we take the view that _phonology_ is _pertinacious_ and changes are rigidly
constrained. The principle of _Pertinacity_ allows us to elucidate the expectations and to
understand the reasons behind the WHYs and WHY NOTs of phonological change.

We take the view that _phonology_ is _pertinacious_ and changes are rigidly constrained. The
principle of _Pertinacity_ allows us to elucidate the expectations and to understand the reasons
behind the issues of the WHYs and WHY NOTs of phonological change.
In this talk, on examining (i) regular phonological changes ensuing from synchronic alternations,
(ii) phonological adaptations of loanwords, and (iii) experimental evidence from language
processing of L1 and L2 speakers, we find that phonological grammars do constrain word
production and comprehension as well as how they changes through generations. On such
evidence, drawing on a variety of languages including Bengali, Dutch, English, German and
Norwegian, we are further fleshing out the notion of _Pertinacity_ as a principle defining
variability as well as its limitations.
